    SOF-bilen was a cooperative project between the two student organisations FIA and M-verkstan, 
    with help from Autoliv Link√∂ping (now Veoneer). The goal was to convert an old Volvo 850 to a
    self-driving car in less than three weeks to participate in the student parade at SOF 2017.
    With approximately 2000 hours of work between 10 people, in the end the car was able to drive
    autonomously and it was quite the experience and a great team effort!
